# 911-Calls-Data-Analysis-Project
This project explores 911 emergency call data  using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.


##Features
**Data Cleaning: 
-Handle missing or inconsistent data in the dataset.
**Exploratory Data Analysis:
-Analyze call trends over time (hours, months, weekdays, etc.).
-Explore the types of emergencies and their frequency.
-Examine geographical patterns of calls (using latitude and longitude).
-Analyze response time trends and patterns.
**Data Visualization: 
-Create insightful graphs to visualize trends, patterns, and distributions.

##Technologies Used
Python: Programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
